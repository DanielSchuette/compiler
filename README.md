# Compiler Example
## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple compiler in `C`.

## Compile and Test
Compile sources with any `C` compiler by typing:
```bash
make
```

The `GRAMMAR.md` demonstrates the support expressions. Try compiling an expression by typing:
```bash
./compiler # requires a successful `make', `--help' for additional information
# Type an expression and observe the output
```
